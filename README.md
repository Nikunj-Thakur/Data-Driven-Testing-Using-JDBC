### >You need to have a locally hosted PostgreSQL Database service with some data in Table 'customer'
### >To run, Right-click on AutomateWebPage class and select Run as TestNG.
### >HTML report can be found under test-output/index.html
### >Extent reports can be found under ExtentReport folder
 
# Further Improvements:
### >Parallel execution for distributed execution
### >Multiple browsers handling for cross-browser testing
### >JIRA API integration to update the results in JIRA after the test execution
